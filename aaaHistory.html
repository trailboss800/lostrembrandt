<h1>A Lost Rembrandt Painting is Found</h1>
<p><h3>This account does not begin with a Rembrandt Self Portrait being lost but rather with one being found. On October 24, 2011, at a small town auction in Portland, Oregon, a small painting was put up for bid. It was old and cloudy and didn't attract much attention. It was described as a painting of a man in a coat with a medal hanging from his neck. The piece was unsigned and the artist unknown. I placed a bid and won the item.</p>
<p>As I examined my newly acquired painting it occurred to me that I was looking at a portrait of the famous painter Rembrandt. Probably executed by a student or a later follower.</p>
<p>It was only after much research that it was decided that the painting was probably an authentic work by Rembrandt and that it had been lost shortly after the artist's death in 1669.</p>
<p>In the 1650's, Leopoldo de' Medici, Cardinal, Florence decided it would be fashionable to assemble a collection of popular artist self portraits. Using these, Leopoldo had the wall of small paintings assembled in his villa. Rembrandt was one of the artists represented.</h3></p>

<p><h3>In the mid 17th century, the standard units of length were arm length and hand width, and because everyone has different arm lengths and hand widths, the paintings in Leopoldo's collection were all different sizes.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1667, Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici asked his nephew Cosimo to visit the studio of Rembrandt, the famous painter, and to deliver to Rembrandt the small self portrait with instructions for Rembrandt to create a larger copy of the painting that reflected his more advanced age.</p>
<p>Cosimo III de' Medici again visited Rembrandt's studio on June 29, 1669, but this time he was there to collect the larger self portrait painted by Rembrandt. This painting is known as RRP IV 28 and is shown below.</h3></p>

<p><h3>The larger self portrait of Rembrandt fit perfectly with the other enlarged artist paintings and became part of the de' Medici gallery of Artist Self Portraits. The above painting was one of the last produced by Rembrandt as he died on October 4, 1669, just three months after Cosimo's visit.</h3></p>
<p><h3>On Cosimo III's return to Florence, Cardinal Leopoldo inspected his new Rembrandt self portrait and was pleased, but he forgot about the smaller self portrait.  As word of Rembrandt's death eventually reached Cardinal de Medici in Florence, word also spread about the increased price and demand of Rembrandt paintings. This news prompted Cardinal de Medici to inquire with Cosimo about the smaller Rembrandt self portrait.  Cosimo resported that it had not been collected from the studio. </h3></p>
<p><h3>In early 1670, Cosimo returned to Rembrandt's studio to retrieve the smaller Rembrandt self portrait. The studio was quiet except for a couple of lingering previous students of the master. Cosimo explained that he was there on behalf of Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici to collect the smaller self portrait of Rembrandt.  Unknown to Cosimo, his request sent the students into a panic because the small self portrait was missing. After Rembrandt's death, admirers of the great artist flocked to his studio in search of anything the great artist may have used or even touched. Clothes, paint brushes, canvases all walked out and apparently so did the small self portait.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Cosimo's insistence that he could not return to Florence without the small self portrait did nothing to reduce the panic felt by Rembrandt's students. They did not have the original and the Master was no longer with them to produce another. They considered their options and finally decided to take a student painting of the master and cut it down to the size of the lost small self portrait. Cosimo could then take the student painting back with the hope that the Cardinal wouldn't notice. Unfortunately the small Rembrandt self portrait had been on display for years in the Cardinal's bedroom, he would notice.</h3></p>
<p><h3>When Cosimo returned to Florence, he was understandably reluctant to show the small painting to the Cardinal, but after a couple of weeks he had no choice. On seeing the small painting to say that the Cardinal was disappointed would be an understatement. Writing in his journal, the Cardinal stated that the painting was a horrible fake and his nephew Cosimo was destined to be a failure at life. The Cardinal ordered the small painting to be hung in the basement where it resides to this day. It's location "Galleria Palatina ed Appartamenti Reali (Palazzo Pitti) Piazza Pitti, 1 - Firenze" .</h3></p>
<p><h3>Shown below is the student version of Rembrandt's self portrait currently in the Palazzo Pitti.</h3></p>
